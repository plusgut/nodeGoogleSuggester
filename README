To use the script just do this: node suggest.js KEYWORD

I added a php-file to show the output of the node-script
but I don't recommend to use the php-script, because of these reasons:
	1) Its slow, and you don't see the beauty of node (its highly event-based)
	2) If you make to much requests, google maybe do not visit your server again 

Licence of the scripts: MIT

If you have any questions, just ask (but please in the issues-box)
